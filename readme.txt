1. Please add constants on your own based on your accounts. i.e, MongoDB, Twitter etc. Also make sure there is no two-factor auth enabled in your twitter.
    This bot can update username password and email.
2. Create a database and a collection in your MongoDB Atlas based on the db and collections specified in the code.
3. ProxyMesh could not be implemented as there was some issue in their site. I was not able to configure my account details due to that. proxymesh.com redirects you to some other website.
3. Looking forward to hearing from you.
